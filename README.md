# udin-task1

## 1- Methodology I used
first before using the AI provider(Claude) to implement my code,I planned the structure,the language that should be used,the prompts and also the complexity of the project with another AI tool(chatgpt). then after that i gave claude the prepared prompts and tried as much as i can to gain from him the core and most important parts of the project to focus on modifing the rest by my own.

## 2- languages and libraries used
### for task1,2 i did it with pythton and with library called pygame, 
### for task3 i used library called falsk

## 3- challenges faced

-  I faced issues to setup python in VS code at first bec. the python version i had was more updated than the pygame library, so i installed an older version.
-  Task 2 had more details than the rest, so I had to restructure task 1 code to be more organized and readable instead of the 1 file project that usually the prompts do. and I did it by planning structure for the project then relocating the code to it's desired location
