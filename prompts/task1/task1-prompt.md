\# prompts used for task1

before implementing the game, first planed for the prompts
structure,language i should do.then after that:

ðŸ”¹ Prompt 1 -- Project Setup "Create a complete Pygame project for a
Sokoban clone. Include a grid-based map, player sprite, wall tiles,
movable blocks, and goal tiles. The player should be able to move with
arrow keys in all directions. Blocks can only be pushed (not pulled),
and only one block can be pushed at a time. Structure the code with
main.py, assets folder, and a level map file." ðŸ”¹ Prompt 2 -- Player
Movement "Write the player movement logic for the Sokoban clone in
Pygame. The player should move one tile at a time using arrow keys.
Prevent movement through walls. If the player tries to move into a
block, push it only if the space behind it is empty." ðŸ”¹ Prompt 3 --
Level Design "Add a simple level system using a text file (like
level1.txt) where: \# = wall, . = floor, @ = player, \$ = box, \* =
goal, + = box on goal. Parse this file to build the level at runtime."
ðŸ”¹ Prompt 4 -- Win Condition "Add win condition logic: when all boxes
are on goal tiles, display a 'Level Complete' message and allow the
player to restart or load the next level." ðŸ”¹ Prompt 5 -- Polishing "Add
sound effects for moving, pushing blocks, and completing a level. Add
restart ('R') and undo ('U') key controls. Make the grid visually
pleasing with basic sprites or colors."
